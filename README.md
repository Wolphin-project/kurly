# Curly Fries, AKA curly

Curly Fries is an alternative to the widely popular curl program, built with
security and memory safety in mind.

curly is designed to operate in a similar manner to curl, with select features.
Notably, curly is not aiming for feature parity, but common flags and mechanisms
particularly within the HTTP(S) realm are to be expected.
